<h1>Famous lyrics</h1>
    <h2><u>I shot the Sherrif</u></h2>
    <p>
        <b>I shot the sheriff</b>, but I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy
All around in my home town
They're trying to track me down
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy
For the life of a deputy, but I say
I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense
I shot the sheriff, and they say it is a capital offense
    </p><hr>
    <h3><u>No woman No cry</u></h3>
    <p>
        <b>No, woman, no cry</b>
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
'Cause, 'cause, 'cause I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba observing the 'ypocrites
Mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I seh
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry
    </p>
